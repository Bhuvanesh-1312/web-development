          <b>Becoming Iron Man</b> In 2010, Stark travels to war-torn
          Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel
          James Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the
          demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded
          and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho
          Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep
          shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him. Stark and
          Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an
          arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered
          armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen sacrifices
          himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark
          battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns
          the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the
          desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his
          company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop,
          Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor
          suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor. Stark learns that Obadiah
          Stane has been engaged in arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and
          is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in
          his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane
          ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest,
          revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark
          manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats
          Stane. The next day, The Chronicles dubs Tony's alter-ego "The Iron
          Man" on their newspaper headline, which he likes and takes the
          moniker, feeling it is catchy and sounded great when saying, evoking
          an aura of him being invincible despite the inaccuracy (the suit is
          made of titanium gold instead of iron). At a press conference, Stark
          publicly admits to being Iron Man.

          <b>Battling Vanko</b> Six months later in 2011, Stark's fame has
          grown, and he uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting
          government pressure to sell his designs, while other inventors try to
          build their own power suits that imitate Stark's with no successes. He
          reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy but
          discovers that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark
          alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing
          increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, he
          appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries. Stark competes in the
          Monaco Historic Grand Prix and is attacked mid-race by Ivan Vanko, who
          wields electrified whips powered by a miniature arc reactor. Stark
          dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely
          damaged. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the
          Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to
          restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the
          Mark II for the U.S. Air Force. Stark discovers a hidden message from
          his father, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark
          successfully synthesizes and integrates into his arc reactor as a
          non-toxic replacement for palladium. At the Expo, Stark's rival Justin
          Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily
          weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the
          newly-built Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes
          control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man.
          Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. After narrowly
          saving Pepper Potts from a self-destructing drone, they start a
          relationship.

          <b>The Battle of New York</b> In 2012, when the Asgardian Loki arrives
          and begins menacing Earth, seizing the Tesseract from a S.H.I.E.L.D.
          facility, Fury activates the Avengers Initiative and Agent Phil
          Coulson visits Stark to have him review the research of Erik Selvig on
          the Tesseract. In Stuttgart, Steve Rogers and Loki fight briefly until
          Tony Stark appears in his Iron Man armor, resulting in Loki's
          surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor arrives
          and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return
          to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to
          take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier.
          The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the
          revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop
          weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling
          one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers must work to
          restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki,
          simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them
          publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the
          Tesseract to open a wormhole in New York City above the Stark Tower to
          allow the Chitauri fleet in space to invade. Fury's superiors from the
          World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a
          nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile,
          and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the
          wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying
          the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's
          suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the
          Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. Stark and the other
          Avengers capture Loki and Thor takes custody of him.

          <b>Creating Ultron</b> In 2015, Stark and the Avengers raid a Hydra
          facility commanded by Wolfgang von Strucker, who has been
          experimenting on siblings Pietro and Wanda Maximoff using the scepter
          previously wielded by Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark
          enters the lab and finds the scepter, along with Chitauri ships from
          the Battle of New York under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him
          and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision:
          the death of all the Avengers except him. Stark awakens from the
          vision and retrieves Loki's scepter. Returning to the Avengers Tower,
          Stark and Bruce Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the
          scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's
          "Ultron" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron
          eliminates Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers.
          Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones,
          kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible
          for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find
          and attack Ultron in Johannesburg, but Wanda subdues most of the team
          with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform
          into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk
          armor. After hiding at Clint Barton's house, Nick Fury arrives and
          encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is
          discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a
          new body for him. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and
          retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning
          to Avengers Tower, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark
          and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after
          hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor
          returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow
          was part of his vision. This "Vision" and the Maximoffs, now on their
          side, accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has
          used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift part of the
          capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause
          global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the
          machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine
          and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base in upstate
          New York, and Stark leaves the team.

          <b>Infinity War</b> In 2018, Stark and Potts are in a New York City
          park discussing having children, when Banner, who had disappeared
          after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the New York Sanctum.
          Banner relays a warning to Stephen Strange, Wong, and Stark that the
          mad Titan Thanos plans to use the Infinity Stones to kill half of all
          life in the universe. Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrive to retrieve
          the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong, and Parker to confront
          them. Although Cull Obsidian is incapacitated, Strange is captured by
          Maw. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship to rescue him.
          After successfully freeing Strange and killing Maw, the trio proceed
          to Thanos' home planet Titan, where they meet members of the Guardians
          of the Galaxy. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the
          Infinity Gauntlet, but Thanos overpowers the group and stabs Stark in
          the abdomen. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos
          sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs for Earth, retrieves
          the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark and
          Nebula, stranded on Titan, watch as Parker and others are turned to
          dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Time Heist and sacrifice</b> Stark and Nebula are rescued from
          space by Carol Danvers and returned to Earth, where Stark chooses to
          retire and raise his daughter Morgan, with Potts. Later, he constructs
          a secret beach house lab in Mexico for Banner to merge his two
          identities and spent some time with him including making a tiki bar.
          In 2023, when Scott Lang hypothesizes a way to bring back the fallen,
          the Avengers approach Stark, who initially refuses, considering the
          idea dangerous. Despite this, he examines the matter privately,
          discovers time travel, and agrees to help. The Avengers reassemble and
          plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past to undo Thanos'
          actions. Traveling to 2012, Stark fails to retrieve the Space Stone
          following the Battle of New York and instead goes further back to the
          1970s to steal it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where he has a
          meaningful conversation with a younger version of his father, Howard.
          The Avengers successfully obtain all of the Infinity Stones before
          returning to the present. The Stones are incorporated into a Nano
          Gauntlet made by Stark, which Banner then uses to resurrect those that
          were disintegrated by Thanos. However, they are followed by an
          alternate version of Thanos and his army, who are summoned to 2023 by
          an alternate version of Nebula. During the ensuing battle, Thanos
          obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of
          it. Thanos is able to overpower Stark before attempting another snap
          but discovers that Stark has transferred the Infinity Stones to his
          own armor. Stark activates the Gauntlet and uses it to disintegrate
          Thanos and all of his forces and save the universe, but fatally
          injures himself in the process. He dies surrounded by Rhodes, Parker,
          and Potts.
