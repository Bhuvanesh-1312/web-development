            <p>
                  Formula One (F1) is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing
                  cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World
                  Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in
                  1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to
                  the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
                  known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either
                  purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

                  A points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for
                  the drivers, and one for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid
                  Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade
                  One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.

                  Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering
                  speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by
                  front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics,
                  suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic
                  driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001 but were banned once
                  more in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\1985_European_GP_Stefan_Johansson_01.jpg" heights="250" width="300"><br>
            <p>
                  Formula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers'
                  Championship (1931–1939). The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow.
                  Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand
                  Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's
                  official start.Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a
                  new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the
                  conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become
                  effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.

                  The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in
                  the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950.Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers'
                  World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in
                  1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957.This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single
                  driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.

                  Promoters also held races following Formula One regulations outside the championship for many
                  years.These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World
                  Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.For
                  example, South Africa's domestic Formula One championship from 1960 to 1975 used locally built or
                  modified cars in addition to recently retired world championship cars.Similarly, the British Formula
                  One Championship utilised second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive
                  fitted with DFV from 1978 to 1980.The increasing cost of competition, however, made such competitions
                  less common in the 1970s. 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of
                  Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a
                  close fight with American Danny Sullivan.

            <h2>Technological developments</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\BMW_Sauber_F1.06_engine.jpg" heights="250" width="300"><br>
            <p>
                  The first major technological development in the series was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined
                  cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's
                  superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961, all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The
                  Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world
                  championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that
                  year.

                  In 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional
                  space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction
                  of mid-engined cars.

                  In 1968, sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette
                  sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston
                  cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1968.Five months later, Lotus, initially
                  using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red,
                  gold, and white colours of Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.

                  Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during
                  the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner, Colin Chapman, who installed modest front
                  wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus
                  introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that
                  provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing
                  the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs
                  were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant
                  that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and
                  driver from irregularities of the road surface.
            </p>
            <h2>Tyre rules</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\Pirelli_Tire_Range_(52849596009).jpg" heights="250" width="300"><br>
            <p>
                  Each driver is allotted four sets of intermediate tyres, three sets of wet-weather tyres and thirteen
                  sets of dry-weather tyres for each race weekend. All unused tyres must be returned.
            </p>
            <h2>Qualifying</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\Circuit_Sochi.svg" heights="250" width="300"><img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\yz9pazdkt6x41.webp" heights="250" width="300"><br>
            <p>
                  For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers
                  would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by
                  each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole
                  position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. Following this, the rules were
                  changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of
                  better track conditions later on.

                  The current qualifying format, known as "knock-out" qualifying, was introduced in the 2006 season. It
                  is divided into three stages, referred to as Q1, Q2, and Q3. Drivers may complete as many laps as they
                  choose in an attempt to progress to the next stage, with the slowest drivers being eliminated at the
                  end of each round. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count
                  toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each session is dependent on the
                  total number of cars entered into the championship.

                  Currently, with 20 cars on the grid, Q1 runs for 18 minutes and eliminates the slowest five drivers.
                  During this session, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will
                  not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards.In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers
                  have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts
                  12 minutes and determines the first ten grid positions.

                  Each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must
                  return them after session; the cars that do not qualify for round can use them during the race.Any
                  penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying.
            </p>
            <h2>Safety car</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\Aston_Martin_Safety_Car_F1_2022.jpg" heights="250" width="300"><br>
            <p>
                  In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race
                  officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This neutralises the race, with drivers required to
                  follow the safety car in race order at reduced speed, and overtaking is not allowed. Cars that have
                  been lapped may, if permitted by the race director, be allowed to unlap themselves in order to ensure
                  a smoother restart. The safety car remains on the track until the danger is cleared. After it comes
                  in, the race restarts with a rolling start, with the leading car taking over its role until they reach
                  the timing line. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great
                  advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period.

                  Mercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since
                  1996.From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage to share duties with Mercedes-AMGs.Since
                  2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayländer.He is usually joined
                  by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race
                  control.
            </p>
            <h2>Cars and technology</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Nurture Infotech\Desktop\bhuvanesh\f1task\Lap4_Canada2005.jpg" heights="250" width="300"><br>
            <p>
                  Modern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters. The
                  chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong.
                  The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 800 kg (1,800 lb) – the minimum weight
                  set by the regulations.If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted
                  to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the
                  extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to
                  improve handling and weight transfer.

                  Aerodynamic downforce generated by the "wings" mounted to the front and rear of Formula One cars
                  alongside ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car, plays a large
                  role in determing its speed.Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed, and
                  a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering.

                  The other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From
                  1998 to 2008, Formula One did not use "slicks" as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each
                  tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of
                  the cars.Slick tyres were reintroduced by Formula One in the 2009 season, and are now exclusively
                  supplied by Pirelli.[255] Formula One cars must also have four wheels made of the same metallic
                  material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA.Magnesium alloy wheels made
                  by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction.[257] As of 2022, the wheels
                  are covered with standardised Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18
                  inches, and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.

                  For most of the 21st century, Formula One cars have used double wishbone or multilink front and rear,
                  with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis, though there have been some notable
                  exceptions. In 2009, the Red Bull Racing RB5 used a pullrod suspension at the rear.Ferrari used a
                  pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their 2012 car.[260] In 2022, the McLaren MCL36 and
                  the Red Bull Racing RB18 switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear
                  suspension.Carbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance.
                  The carbon material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance under extreme heat. To
                  optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring maximum performance and cooling.
